# Vehicle Detection using Cascade Classifier based on HOG Features using S32V234 and MATLAB
This prototype helps detect vehicles in video frames using Cascade Classifiers (VDCC) based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features.Using S32V234 and MATLAB's S32V234 Vision toolbox a vehicle detection model was developed to help autonomous vehicles easily navigate by mitigating collisions on road.
